## Features

- End to end trainable
- Dropout is used to reduce overfitting

## Training

- Dataset:
    - SBD for training
    - PascalVoc11 (without samples used in the training split of SBD) ignoring the border (255 or class 21)
    - The input is in the BGR format and only centered using channels-mean [103.949 , 116.799, 123.68] and in scale [0 - 255] not [0 - 1]

- VGG16 pretrained weights:
    - Used the caffe pretrained weight following the paper.
    - Last classification layer weights is discarder.
    - All the other layers weights has been transfered, even the linear layer weights but reshaped of course.

- The training follow the Heavy training procedure as described in the original paper:
    - Batch size: 1
    - Image with original Size
    - Loss is not averaged because of the fact there will be different size during training, so it is summed (for this reason the LR of 1e-10 for FCN32s and so on)
    - Momentum:  0.99 (This value is based on the fact that there is a relation between batch size and momentum , so in the paper it was considered a batch size of 20 with a momentum of 0.9 for standard training. The equivalent momentum for a batch size of 1 is equal to 0.99 [0.9
    (1/20) â‰ˆ 0.99]. Read the paper for more details)
