## Training

- **Dataset:**
    - SBD dataset is used for training.
    - PascalVoc11 (excluding samples used in the training split of SBD), ignoring the border (255 or class 21).
    - The input is in the BGR format and is centered using channel means [103.949, 116.799, 123.68]. The scale is [0 - 255], not [0 - 1].

- **VGG16 pretrained weights:**
    - Caffe pretrained weights were used following the paper.
    - The weights of the last classification layer are discarded.
    - All other layer weights have been transferred, including the linear layer weights, but reshaped accordingly.

- **Training Procedure:**
    - The training follows the Heavy training procedure outlined in the original paper:
        - Batch size: 1
        - Images with original size
        - Loss is not averaged due to varying sizes during training; it is summed. Hence, the learning rate of 1e-10 for FCN32s, 1e-12 fpr FCN16s and 1e-14 for FCN8s.
        - Momentum: 0.99 (This value is chosen based on the relation between batch size and momentum. In the paper, a batch size of 20 with a momentum of 0.9 is considered for standard training. The equivalent momentum for a batch size of 1 is approximately 0.99 [0.9 * (1/20) â‰ˆ 0.99]. Refer to the paper for more details.)
- **Augmentation:**
    - No augmentation was used as its inclusion did not yeld better results.
